1. a building system in lua; now use makefile 1st

2. We do not check instruction validity for the non-functional fields,
   e.g. the shamnt field of addu instruction. In this way we save some
   checking efforts, but seems not good as it does not comply with the
   spec.

3. finish all R-type instructions by today May 27 2012.
