* core should generate logic memory address

* use lua to construct memory with table, and access the memory from C
  via C-lua interface

* a building system in lua; now use makefile 1st

   spec.

* finish all R-type instructions by today May 27 2012. -- failed... still working

* to get GCC mips tool chain
